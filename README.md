SkillVault is a revolutionary online learning platform built to make skill learning affordable, enjoyable, and efficient. SkillVault solves the common problems of conventional online learning like exorbitant prices, poor completion rates, and inefficient learning processes. SkillVault is a task-based, game-like learning system in which learners engage actively with micro-learning modules and are rewarded for completion.
The model of SkillVault centers on a token-based system. Students are rewarded with tokens when they complete tasks and quizzes, and tokens can be redeemed for new lessons and course material. This reward system not only incentivizes learning, but also gives students a tangible sense of accomplishment and progress. By breaking up complex subjects into tangible tasks like writing summaries or programming small functions, SkillVault facilitates hands-on usage and deeper comprehension. This active learning process results in much higher retention of knowledge compared to passive learning processes. SkillVault also uses AI-supported assistance to optimize learning. A robot AI responds with instant response and direction, monitoring learner frustration and offering personalized assistance. The AI also generates customized learning paths, which dynamically adjust according to the user's progress, maintaining relevance and challenging character. This customized process makes the learning process optimal for all learners, in terms of highest efficiency and productivity.
